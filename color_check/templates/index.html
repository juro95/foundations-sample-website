<p> Here's your starting point. You will want to edit this file to include instructions for your users.
    There should be an HTML form here which gets a string from a user, and sends that information to the backend
    to check if the color is a valid CSS color or not.

<p>Please type in the color of which you want to have the color code of</p>
<!-- when the user submits this form, it will send the information submitted from the client (frontend)
    to the server (backend). It will send that infromation to a particular URI, at "/color". 
    Your server will then run the code which is defined in website.py at that route. -->

<form action="/color" method="post" class="color">
    <!-- add the contents of your form here -->
    <label for="name"> Color: </label>
    <input type="text" name="color" id="color" required>
    <button id="color">Submit</button>
</form>
